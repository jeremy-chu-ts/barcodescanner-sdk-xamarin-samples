# Scandit Samples for Xamarin

This repository contains sample applications that show how to use the Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK together with Xamarin.

- The `Native` folder contains an Android and iOS specific sample. These samples are built with the platform-specific [Scandit.BarcodePicker.Xamarin](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scandit.BarcodePicker.Xamarin/) package. This API gives you the most control over the barcode scanning process, but also requires you to write the code for each platform separately.
- The `Unified` folder contains two cross-platform samples using Xamarin Forms. These samples are built with platform-independent [Scandit.BarcodePicker.Xamarin](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scandit.BarcodePicker.Unified/) package. 

You can build the samples with Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio. For more information take a look at the [Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK documentation for Xamarin](http://docs.scandit.com/stable/xamarin/index.html)
